    title: Inventory System
---

As I got more into developing hardware my collection of electronic components also grew and I needed a better way of organizing everything.
I decided that it was a great opertunity to learn React and to develop the frontend of my very own simple inventory management system.
The system uses QR codes to link the physical components to their representation in the mangement system, which contains more information on the specific component like for example datasheets.
It also stores where each of the components is supposed to be stored, which makes it very easy to find components in the future.
