    title: Z80 Computer
---

The first big hardware project that I worked on was building a computer, from the ground up, around the [Z80] microprocessor.
I had to learn a wide range of skills for this project, including things like learning how to design PCBs, programming in assembly, working with [FPGA]s, and learning to operate an oscilloscope.
