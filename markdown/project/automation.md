    title: Home Automation
---

I have slowly been converting my house into my very own smart home!
It all started with a couple of Philips Hue light bulbs, the Hue app allows for some level of automation but it wasn't quite doing what I wanted.
So initially I wrote a very simple program in [Go] to add my own automations.
As I added more smart devices to my house, the program grew massively in scope with things quickly getting hacked in just to make it work.
Eventually I decided to rewrite the whole thing in Rust!
This was my first real Rust after picking up the language during [Advent of Code] and was (and still is) a great learning experience.
