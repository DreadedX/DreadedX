This is my most recent project, as I had recently decided to pick up a [Raspberry Pi Pico W] just to play around with.
I decided to build a device to read out my [DSMR5] based smart meter using it's P1 port and publish the information using MQTT.
The main intention of this project is to learn about Rust for embedded devices, which is still a very new ecosystem.
So far it has been quite a nice experience!
