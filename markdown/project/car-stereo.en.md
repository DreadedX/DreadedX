My Peugeot 207 only has bluetooth for calling, so I decided it would be fun to build my own bluetooth receiver using the [ESP32] microcontroller.
The original goal was to just build an audio receiver and hook it up to the aux port in my glovebox.
However since then I have also connected the [ESP32] to the [CAN bus] of my car, allowing me to use the controls on my steering wheel to control the music.
