Ever since I was young I have always been interested in technology, whether it was taking apart (broken) electronics or playing around on my parents computer.
In high school I discovered that I also really liked physics, so that is what I ended up studying, but programming always remained one of my hobbies.
A couple of years ago I picked up the programming language [Rust] and all my personal projects since have been build with it!

I also discovered I enjoyed working with hardware during my minor in Electronics for Robotics and have since worked on a variety of hardware related projects at home as well.
One example would be adding bluetooth audio to my car, which included hacking into the CAN bus to integrate with the normally CD only steering wheel controls.

I'm also a big Linux fan and have run it as my main operating system for well over a decade at this point, I even game in a virtual machine so I technically never have to leave Linux!
This has since expanded to running my own Linux server at home and more recently tinkering with a bare metal Kubernetes cluster at home.
