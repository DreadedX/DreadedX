An Applied Physics student with a passion for programming!

I have always enjoyed programming as a hobby, and would love to make it my career.
Since then I have also combined this hobby with the hardware side of things.
Most recently I have picked up [Rust], and have fallen in love with this programming language.

I'm also quite experienced with Linux as I have been daily driving it for the past decade at this point.
Making me very familiar with the terminal and the different command line tools available.
And have even been running my own Linux server at home for quite some time now!
